## Overview

I built an E-commerce product page using HTML SASS and Javascript. I faced some challenges with the light-box but I overcame them. Through this project, I learned how to dynamically add, edit, clone and modify content and even style better.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
